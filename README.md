This app is built to create your very own world of warcraft parties by importing a guild! 

To get started log in with a battle net account through the Blizzard Authentication. If you dont have one, I have provided one up top.

Once in, import a guild using the guild import feature.

After that just search for the guild and click the name and have fun creating your very own parties!
